# Predictive-Demand-Forecasting-for-Foodbanks
**IN PROGRESS**   
This project trains a machine learning model in python using sci-kit learn to predict daily demand for food banks. The final deliverable is an interactive dashboard in Tableau that visualizes the forecasted weekly client demand, resulting in optimized inventory management and reduction in food waste.

**PROGRESS**   
DONE: Generated synthesized foodbank data and obtained public unemployment and SNAP application data.  
NOW: Building ML model in Python using sci-kit learn.  
NEXT: Build dashboard visualizing forecasted demand.  
FUTURE: Present live demo to local food banks in an effort to implement this helpful tool and make real impact on local community.
